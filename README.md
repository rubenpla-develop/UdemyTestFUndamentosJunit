# UdemyTestFUndamentosJunit

Espresso, JUnit, Mockito, Robolectric cover basic and advanced topics, with multiple popular and modern tools for creating tests that validate your code and allow your projects to constantly evolve without losing quality. Examples of functional apps with MVVM, LiveData, Retrofit, and more are included.

Creating a functional application is important; however, it is necessary to test that everything goes well and that there are no errors that provide incorrect results or even cause our apps to crash abruptly. Manual tests are inefficient and costly, which is why there is a need to automate tests once and let the computer perform massive tests in a short amount of time, with reliability proportional to the quality of our software.

Here is a small list of the most popular topics covered in the course:

JUnit

TDD

Hamcrest

Mockito

Robolectric

AndroidX Test

Component Architecture

FragmentDialogs

Scenarios

Espresso

Retrofit

LiveData

Coroutines

Annotations

Rules

Configurations

And much more...

This course is designed for you to learn while practicing. Different Android applications are included, with unique internal structures, using different types of files, design patterns, libraries, and all kinds of variations to make testing tools clear regarding which types of tests are more important or what problems they solve.

The instructors who have designed this course are highly skilled professionals, and the hundreds of thousands of students who are part of Frogrames and CursosAndroidANT support their reputation as dedicated teachers.

One very important aspect is that the applications used in the course are already created, so you won't waste time building Android applications. We will only focus on implementing unit tests or instrumented tests that allow us to test different types of functions, use cases, and specific problems that come with the Android SDK.

An important point is the example of developing quality software with official recommendations and high-level techniques like TDD, so that we not only learn to create tests correctly, but also benefit from them to improve our existing and future code.
